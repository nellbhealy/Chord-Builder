# Chord-Builder

Chord-Builder is a project for COMP580: Enabling Technologies with Gary Bishop. It is a game intended for people with visual impairments who utilize screen readers, as well as people with physical disabilities who lack the fine motor skills that many digital games oftentimes require. 

## Game Objective

The goal of this game is to build a correct chord. The four notes that compose the chord will be displayed on a staff, and the notes will be played together at the beginning of gameplay. The player must listen carefully to the chord, as some of the chord's notes may be incorrect by a step or half-step; however, the base note (first note) of the chord will always be correct. The player is tasked with correcting these mistakes by changing the accidental of the incorrect notes.

To navigate between different notes, use the left and right arrow keys. To change the accidental of a note, use the spacebar. Upon navigating to a different note/changing the note's accidental, the note will be played. Upon navigating back to the base note, all four notes will be played in turn, then simultaneously to play the chord. 

When the player has successfully corrected the chord, they will move on to another chord, and the gameplay starts again.
